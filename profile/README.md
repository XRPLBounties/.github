XRPL Bounties was a program to fund software developers and teams for the completion of specific ideas and projects that benefit the XRP Ledger (XRPL) community. 

In the spirit of the public and transparent XRP Ledger, everything built for XRPL Bounties is fully open source and all ideas are released into the public domain.

**XRPL Bounties has been sunset in order to refocus on the [XRPL Grants](https://xrplgrants.org/) and [Accelerator](https://xrplaccelerator.org/) programs. As such, XRPL Bounties is no longer creating any new bounties.**

Note: This is not a bug bounty program. If you are looking for a bug bounty program, check out Ripple’s **[here](https://ripple.com/legal/bug-bounty/)**.
