XRPL Bounties is an XRP Ledger developer bounty program where funds are set aside for the completion of specific features and projects that benefit the XRPL community. The target audience is software developers with expertise or experience in specific industries or vertical markets where high priority needs have been identified.

(This program provides funding for the development of open source software and integrations. **XRPL Bounties** is not a bug bounty program; however, there is a separate **[Ripple Bug Bounty Program](https://ripple.com/legal/bug-bounty/)**.)

# XRPL Bounties is currently in private beta.

## The Bounty Lifecycle

1. **Initial proposal** - you, or anyone in the community, can share an idea by [starting a `New discussion`](https://github.com/XRPLBounties/Proposals/discussions).

2. **Formal spec** - propose formal requirements and propose a bounty amount by [opening a Pull Request](https://github.com/XRPLBounties/Bounties/pulls).

3. **Proposal review** - the Developer Growth Engineering (DGE) team will review the proposal for value-add and technical feasibility. Suggestions, comments, and questions will be made directly on the pull request. If/when the proposal receives at least 3 approvals on the PR, it will move forward to formal approval.

4. **Formal approval** - the PR will be approved for a particular bounty amount. If approved, the bounty will have a dedicated budget set aside for its completion. The PR will then be merged into the repo. **Bounties are not available to be picked up until after they have been merged into `main`.**

5. **Open for submissions** - the bounty will open for developers to pick up. During this time, developers onboard through a lightweight approval process in order to ensure eligibility. **Developers are not eligible to receive a bounty until they have completed compliance approval.** Depending on the urgency and scope of the bounty, it may remain open for anywhere between 1-6 months.

6. **Review of submissions** - DGE will review submissions as they come in, with a response time of 5 business days or less. Submissions that successfully meet all the criteria for a milestone payout will move to the next step.

7. **Approval of bounty payout** - the payout will be approved and completed.
