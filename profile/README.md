# XRPL Bounties 💰

XRPL Bounties sets aside pre-defined funding for the completion of specific ideas and projects that benefit the XRP Ledger community.

# XRPL Bounties is currently in private beta.

## The Bounty Lifecycle

1. **Initial proposal** - you, or anyone in the community, can share an idea by [creating an issue](https://github.com/XRPLBounties/Bounties/issues/new).

2. **Formal spec** - propose formal requirements and propose a bounty amount by [opening a Pull Request](https://github.com/XRPLBounties/Bounties/pulls).

3. **Proposal review** - the Developer Growth Engineering (DGE) team will review the proposal for value-add and technical feasibility. Suggestions, comments, and questions will be made directly on the pull request. If/when the proposal receives at least 3 approvals on the PR, it will move forward to formal approval.

4. **Formal approval** - the PR will be approved for a particular bounty amount. If approved, the bounty will have a dedicated budget set aside for its completion. The PR will then be merged into the repo. **Bounties are not available to be picked up until after they have been merged into `main`.**

5. **Open for submissions** - the bounty will open for developers to pick up. During this time, developers onboard through a lightweight approval process in order to ensure eligibility. **Developers are not eligible to receive a bounty until they have completed compliance approval.** Depending on the urgency and scope of the bounty, it may remain open for anywhere between 1-6 months.

6. **Review of submissions** - DGE will review submissions as they come in, with a response time of 5 business days or less. Submissions that successfully meet all the criteria for a milestone payout will move to the next step.

7. **Approval of bounty payout** - the payout will be approved and completed.
